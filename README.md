C:\Users\alina\sites\refactor-homework\index.html file changes:

    1. Refactored exisitng webpage to use the accessibility standards, like alt attributes describing the images
    2. Replaced title with the name of the company "Horiseon"
    3. Replaced <DIV> and classes with the semantic HTML elements: <HEADER>, <H1>, <NAV>, <MAIN>, <SECTION>, <FOOTER>
    4. Added classes to the HTML tags as neccessary for styling
    5. Added ID "search-engine-optimization" for navigation

C:\Users\alina\sites\refactor-homework\assets\css\style.css file changes:

    1. Changed classes to semantic elements
    2. Used descendant selectors instead of classes to define the style of the elements
    3. Organized and combined multiple classes into one class to avoid repetition

WHEN I viewed the source code
THEN I finded semantic HTML elements
WHEN I viewed the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I found that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I viewed the image elements
THEN I found accessible alt attributes
WHEN I viewed the heading attributes
THEN they falled in sequential order
WHEN I viewed the title element
THEN I found a concise, descriptive title
